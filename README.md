# Fab Academy Instruction 2018

Prior to Fab Academy, there are a number of things that instructors need to do to prepare for the upcoming cycle. Each cycle is slightly different, so flexibility and agility is essential throughout.

The first steps, loosely in order are:

1. Establish your core local instructor team. Ideally that would be two or three people, with varying styles and skills.
2. Ensure that you have all the equipment and inventory required for Fab Academy.
3. Apply to host academy as a node.
4. Apply to be a local instructor.

## Marketing

Begin to market Fab Academy to your local community via your usual channels - instagram, facebook, slack, posters/flyers etc. Use the marketing material provided by Fab Academy coordination which is located in an Academany [repository](https://github.com/Academany) on Github (at the moment). 

Post photos of successful graduates and their work to announce that your lab is hosting Fab Academy again in 2018. Focus more on group photos than individual. You're trying to attract people who like working with others. If it's a photo of someone's final project, you can say "Do you want to learn how to make something like this?" 

Host information evenings and advertise them as above. Talk about who will be the instructors this cycle and the overall programme. Speak of your experience with Fab Academy and show a bit of your progress on your page. Invite another graduate to talk as well. Laugh and agree with each other a lot. Have a slide show on a big screen as people enter the room - photos of you all working hard, making things, your final project slides, photos at Fab 13. Show people around the lab at the end so then you can point out the equipment that was used for each project. Display the final projects and the MTM project (if they all still exist) nearby so you can point them out. If you haven't got those, point out other projects that use similar skills. Make sure you have the application forms up on a computer for people to fill out straightaway. Or a paper version. 

## Selecting students

I can be available for short conversations with potential students in my evening/your morning. 

## Pre Academy activities

I suggest that you offer some sessions during your winter holiday. These sessions will serve three purposes: to introduce the students to some basic skills, to introduce them to the ethos of the programme and thirdly, **most importantly**, introduce them to each other. Building a strong team feeling early in the programme will help everyone to succeed together instead of competitively. I can phone in as the 'regional reviewer' and Carl can be a remote student. It'll be a taste of the global programme in every way.

Activities that I suggest are:

- learning about Open Source licenses. Look at the Creative Commons [website](https://creativecommons.org/) and examine a few examples of people using open licenses - Ultimaker, thingiverse, wikipedia. Do the group project for the 3D printing week: download a torture test from thingiverse. Check and discuss the license - what would you write on your fab academy page to acknowledge this license?

- learn about using BASH. Follow the Bash for Beginners [tutorial](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting) or another tutorial that you like more.

- learn some basics of open source software. Learn how to resize & compress photos using Gimp. Make a vinyl sticker in Inkscape. Make a tinkercad model and print it out, using the knowledge gained from the torture test.  

- do a git tutorial.

- do some W3 [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/). 

I would combine these into 2 sessions, where they do some computing and some making in each. Maybe W3 & OS licenses, then Bash, git & OS software.

Throughout these activities, they must take screenshots and photos & videos of each other doing interesting fabby things and upload them to a shared folder because they can use all of this in their fab Academy documentation. Of course. And also, it's a good habit to start early... #fablabuae #fabacademy2018 etc.

## Teaching ethos

Throughout these sessions, ensure that you are helping them to get to know each other and that they know that you don't know absolutely everything in the whole wide world. We cannot know everything there is to know about everything, but we can teach people how to find information and evaluate the usefulness of the information. The environment that we create now is the one that lasts. 

If someone asks you a question and you have already helped someone else with that, you can say "Mr Blahblah can answer that question" and then you support Mr Blahblah to answer it. If someone is having a problem, check to see if anyone else is having that problem, and invite everyone to come and see a way to solve it. Set up your sessions so that they know that searching on a 'preferred search engine' is often your first step and is just a matter of getting the question right. The attitude you want to communicate throughout is: let's solve this together.
