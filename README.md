# Fab Academy Instruction 2018

Prior to Fab Academy, there are a number of things that instructors need to do to prepare for the upcoming cycle. Each cycle is slightly different, so flexibility and agility is essential throughout.

The first steps, loosely in order are:

1. Establish your core local instructor team. Ideally that would be two or three people, with varying styles and skills.
2. Ensure that you have all the equipment and inventory required for Fab Academy.
3. Apply to host academy as a node.
4. Apply to be a local instructor.

## Marketing

Begin to market Fab Academy to your local community via your usual channels - instagram, facebook, slack, posters/flyers etc. Use the marketing material provided by Fab Academy coordination which is located in an Academany [repository](https://github.com/Academany) on Github (at the moment). 

Post photos of successful graduates and their work to announce that your lab is hosting Fab Academy again in 2018. Focus more on group photos than individual. You're trying to attract people who like working with others. If it's a photo of someone's final project, you can say "Do you want to learn how to make something like this?" 

Host information evenings and advertise them as above. Talk about who will be the instructors this cycle and the overall programme. Speak of your experience with Fab Academy and show a bit of your progress on your page. Invite another graduate to talk as well. Laugh and agree with each other a lot. Have a slide show on a big screen as people enter the room - photos of you all working hard, making things, your final project slides, photos at Fab 13. Show people around the lab at the end so then you can point out the equipment that was used for each project. Display the final projects and the MTM project (if they all still exist) nearby so you can point them out. If you haven't got those, point out other projects that use similar skills. Make sure you have the application forms up on a computer for people to fill out straightaway. Or a paper version. 

## Selecting students

I can be available for short conversations with potential students in my evening/your morning.
