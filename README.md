# Fab Academy Instruction 2018

Prior to Fab Academy, there are a number of things that instructors need to do to prepare for the upcoming cycle. Each cycle is slightly different, so flexibility and agility is essential throughout.

The first steps, loosely in order are:

1. Establish your core local instructor team. Ideally that would be two or three people, of varying styles and skills, with one person leading the team.
2. Ensure that you have all the equipment and inventory required for Fab Academy.
3. Apply to host academy as a node.
4. Apply to be a local instructor.
