## Educational Ethos

Fab Academy is a big challenge for two main reasons. 

1.  Learning new technical skills, both software and hardware.
2.  Learning that *process* is as important as, if not more important than, outcome.

In the context of digital fabrication, you can learn how to use a laser cutter or 3D printer anywhere now, but you can't learn how to learn from your own process just anywhere. Once you do learn how you learn, you can apply it anywhere and to anything.

### Process Context

Most of us are taught within an educational system that is either standards-based or achievement-based. The outcomes are very clear: to achieve the former, you must do a fixed range of things to be successful, whereas in the latter, you are encouraged (through the grading system) to achieve between ~50% and 100%. A perfect mark within the achievement-based system does not mean that the student knows absolutely everything, but that they have acheived all of the things, and possibly more, that the grading schedule recognises as extended skills or knowledge at that level.

These two systems exist because we have 'hard' and 'soft' expertise. For instance, imagine if you needed a Brain Surgeon - would you want a doctor who got 50% right in their exams? No, you want a very high scoring graduate. Whereas, in design disciplines, it is possible to have a variety of styles and methods that aren't necessary but are considered nice to have. In either case, it is recognised that practise improves the initial results and that the original results may be no reflection on the eventuating professional practice.

Although Fab Academy is evaluated to a fairly loosely framed standard, students are encouraged to achieve as much as possible in the course for their own satisfaction. At the same time, perfect success is not the only measure - students are encouraged to document their 'failures' and refect on what they'd do differently next time. I put the word failures in inverted commas because in this context they aren't failures, they are a step towards your final goal. For many people, this is an unfathomable aspect of Fab Academy and when people ask: what is the standard? this is what they are asking about. Often in a standards-based educational environment, you are conditioned to focus only on the successes and because of this conditioning, it feels as though you are admitting that you aren't suitable for the course, that you're not as smart as you need to be etc. 

It is a big leap for graduates of a traditional standards-based system to engage with the seemingly amorphous system of Fab Academy. Spiral Development is the framework within which we work and this is the essence of 'learning how to learn' in a maker-centred learning environment. During Fab Academy, the aim is for students to become more open about their mistakes so that they can reflect on them with their instructor and other fabbers, enabling them to clearly define the parameters of their next experiment. 

For a designer, this process is more integrated into their practise, because design is always experimental. For an engineer, this process is outside their experience because engineering follows specific rules. Because we're operating within a new field, all the rules haven't been made yet, so there is a lot of room for experimentation. We're still constrained by things like the rules of physics, but we can 'play' a lot more.

### Spiral Development

Spiral Development assumes that you don't know everything. It also assumes that even though you might not be generating new knowledge for humanity, you are generating new knowledge for yourself through experiential learning.  If you are aiming to achieve an outcome but you don't know how, or if it's even possible to achieve this, you can ask yourself: what is the first, small project that I can do to test my idea or understanding? I often refer to it as the Bare Minimum. If you were working in the standards-based system, the Bare Minimum would be sufficient. But in Fab Academy you reflect on your findings, evaluate them and go a little further. These are the sort of reflective questions you might ask.
-   Was my first Bare Minimum experiment realistic or do I need to scale it back?
-   Which parts were successful and why?
-   While I was doing this, did I make a surprise discovery that has changed my initial idea?
-   What do I need to do differently or change about my idea to progress it?

With your new understanding, you would ask:

What is the next thing I can do to test whether my idea has merit, or that my new understanding is robust?

You can now see why it's called Spiral Design - each cycle is successful in itself, or allows you to find a first success to build on. One of the big challenges in the early weeks of Fab Academy is to keep building the culture of moving past the Bare Minimum. Because many of our students are so used to the standards-based system, they habitually stop at the Bare Minimum and we have to keep encouraging them to continue. Asking squestions that foster curiosity is a way of doing this. I might ask: are you curious to know whether you can acheive this step now? I wonder what would happen if you tried this? I'm curious - will you indulge me and try this step now?etc

Again, students who are used to the other system will see this as the instructor asking them to do extra work. They ask what is the standard and why do you ask other students to do one thing and me to do somethign else.
