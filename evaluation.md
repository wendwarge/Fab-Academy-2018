# Evaluation

Evaluation is an important part of Fab Academy, not only because it allows us to set a standard, but because it helps us to identify whether our students have learnt the things that we've taught. 

Therefore it is essential that it begins early and is ongoing. If a student's documentation doesn't indicate that they've learnt the necessary things, then we are provided with an extra teaching opportunity and can remedy the situation.

The [General Essentials](http://fabacademy.org/2018/docs/FabAcademy-Assessment/general_essentials.html) section of the Assessment document has 7 points for everyone to keep in mind and lays out the Fab Academy ethos of open documentation. I refer a little more to it in [Project Management](project_management.md)  

*We are not here as Local and Global Evaluators to torture and punish students or each other, or to prove that we are perfect and that we know everything*

This creates an atmosphere of fear, and reluctance to ask 'dumb questions'. On all levels. 

Each layer of evaluation is an opportunity for everyone to learn. Maybe the student has missed some information, maybe the local evaluator didn't know about the skill or technique you think is absolutely essential, maybe the global evaluator doesn't know about the the skill or technique you think is absolutely essential. 

I'm not saying I don't get frustrated sometimes. I know I've taught something on a number of occasions and the students show absolutely no sign of having learnt it. But that's why teaching and learning are two separate things. 

## Why, why, why do we have to describe and explain everything?

Because it proves that you understood _what_ you were doing and _why_ you were doing it. It is not enough to say you did it, you need to say _how_ you did it. Having HTML in your repo is not proof that you understand what it does; explaining elements of HTML proves that you understand it and can adjust it. It will also help others, and yourself, in the future. Think about how much time you have spent looking at other people's work to understand how to do a weekly assignment - it's time to pay it back by offering your own tips and hints. Also, think about how often you wish that you'd made notes on something new or something you don't do very often - it's time to train yourself to do this.

## Local Evauation

Think very carefully about how you set up a collaborative learning environment [see Teaching Ethos](teaching_ethos.md). It may be that it isn't possible within the culture or with the particular group of students you have.

If I have been able to establish a positive group culture, I usually put an analogue version in poster form of the assessment progress in the Fab Academy space. The idea of it is to help the students see how they are progressing in comparison to each other. They will use it to help each other. If two students haven't finished one assignment, they will see it and will work together to finish it. They will congratulate each other on their successes. 

This analogue version also helps to communicate any issues in documentation, like forgetting to document a process - if one person forgets and it's noted on the poster, then the others will see it and realise that they need to document it. Alternatively, if someone gets a very postive feedback, the other students will find out the reason and attempt to replicate that in their own way.

If I haven't been able to build that culture, and there is an atmosphere of mistrust and competitiveness, they will view it as a 'shaming document'. They will get resentful about other people's successes, begin to think that it's not possible to 'beat' that person, that it's unfair, and that it's not possible to please the instructor. I don't know how to fix that. 

In this situation, I would remove the poster (because we're not using it and it's a waste of wall space) or not put it up at all. Also, in this situation, you need to remember that if it's not written down, it doesn't exist. It's been a little disturbing to discover that it's true. If you don't write the feedback in nueval, then it's another thing that your students will act as though they've never heard. While it's useful to sit and discuss progress with individual students, don't forget to write it down where they can also see it.

## Global Evaluation

Global evaluation is another opportunity for intructors to get to know each other, and for the students to meet another person from the network. As a global evaluator, I will usually contact the instructor of the students I am evaluating before I begin and introduce myself. I check the feedback they have written before I write my own. I tend to write a lot in the feedback - sometimes just helpful hints and links, sometimes very clear instructions to improve their documentation so that it meets the objectives. It all depends on the student.

I put my students forward for two reasons:
- because I think that they are ready
- because I want someone else to tell them the things I have been doing so that they'll actually do it 

It's a good idea to let the global evaluator know which category the student is in, via personal message, so that they aren't surprised when they begin the global eval. But if you don't feel comfortable doing that, they will realise anyway. They might wonder whether you know your stuff, but eventually it will become clear. If it does turn out that you don't know your stuff, you will learn something. 

If you are in a situation where you disagree with the global evaluator, *you need to let that go*. It is no longer in your control. Don't harass the global evaluator. You might message them once to explain your perspective, or comment in the nueval if you think they have missed a point, but otherwise, *let it go*. Don't message them constantly at all times of day and night - this will not build a good relationship between you and may affect how they view your students as well as make it hard to build a relationship in the future. Having said that, we're all people, and very forgiving.
