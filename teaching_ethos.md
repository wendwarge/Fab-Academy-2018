# Teaching Ethos

Throughout Fab Academy, but especially these early sessions, ensure that you are helping them to get to know each other and that they know that you don't know absolutely everything in the whole wide world. We cannot know everything there is to know about everything, but we can teach people how to search for information and then evaluate the usefulness of the information that they find. The environment that we create now is the foundation for an inspiring and life changing experience. 

An important part of this is to build the environment that supports 'there is no such thing as a dumb question'. Even if you have answered that exact question many times, it is still the first time that person has asked it. Even if it isn't the first time they ask it and you're thinking 'I taught this to you already!', education is all about teaching **and** learning. Just because you've taught it, doesn't mean the students have learnt it yet. Repitition is inevitable. 

If someone asks you a question and you have already helped someone else with that, you can say "FabberX over there has already faced that issue & can answer that question." and then you support FabberX to answer it. This will help in a few ways - it distributes the education and it encourages FabberX to believe in their own abilities. Repeating the experience for someone else also reinforces the knowledge and helps to build relationships between the fabbers. 

If FabberY is having a problem & asks for help, check to see if anyone else is having that problem, and invite everyone to come and see a way to solve it. One-on-one sessions are valuable, but they're not always scaleable. Each participant in the session will remember different things which will allow them to continue solving this if you're not there. Invite the students to make suggestions, and if there are others in the room, invite them to say what they might do. Set up your sessions so that they know that searching on a 'preferred search engine' is often your first step and is just a matter of getting the question right. The attitude you want to communicate throughout is: let's solve this together. 

Getting the question right. It sounds easy, but I hope you remember how hard it is when you're first searching in the digital fabrication zone. For me, that was particularly true in the early electronics and programming weeks. Add English as an extra challenge and you've doubled the difficulty. This information is often not available in many other languages, and if you try to translate, well - we all know how inaccurate and entertaining those results can be. Anyway, choosing the best words for your search... one of the reasons I search when a student asks me for help is so that they can see what search terms I am using. Depending on what the problem is I will either ask them what three words are the most important in this problem (assuming we're not pasting an error message) and help them identify those, or I will suggest typing in their exact question. Their exact question may have been asked in a forum by a newbie, and the three words clarify the problem for them, and will help them evaluate the search results. One of the things I see at the beginning is that students just click on the first result (often an advertisement), so I also sit with them and go through the first page of results - those three lines of text for each result are super useful in deciding whether to click through, aren't they? But for beginners, they're just a wall of blah-blah-blah.  

It's an interesting exercise in that it can take a while for that process to become normal. Also, students who believe that the instructor/expert should answer all their questions begin to think either that you don't know or that you're withholding knowledge. What you're actually doing is creating an independent learner (see previous page), giving them resilience for the future. One of the reasons that it's good to have a team of instructors is that everyone learns a different way, so if they have a variety of teaching styles available, then more people will learn the way that works for them. However this is still the underlying ethos within the team, no matter how this is delivered to the student.

##### Your ideas about what constitutes effective teaching, in general, and your specific objectives for the course(s) you teach (or will teach).

I teach using a maker-centred approach - this varies according to the needs I identify in the classroom/fab lab. 
There is a strong emphasis on exploration into materials and processes, within an open source ethos. Everyone is encouraged to work together, using peer-learning or distributed learning to build on pre-existing work and to share their discoveries so that everyone succeeds.

A maker-centred approach is combined with a project-based approach during fab academy - given the nature of the weekly assignments, it is essential to provide comprehensive structure to a learning experience. A project-based approach is applied more in the first half of the course, where new concepts are introduced, but in the second half of academy the teaching style becomes more maker-centred. 

My overall objective for the participants in the course is that they become more and more curious about everything. That their confidence increases as the relationships between the students and the instructors become more comfortable. The curiosity and the confidence combine to create an engaged learner who is excited about the possibilities of fab labs, digital fabrication, open source etc and is empowered to get involved.

##### A description of the ways in which you make decisions about course content and teaching methodologies.

It is our job to synthesise the information that is delivered to the students by Neil every week, and to bring that into our local lab in a meaningful way. The way that I do that depends a little on who the students are and a little on who the instructors are. 

A few of the questions I might ask when deciding how to structure a week/course are: What are their strengths, what do they already know, and how does the instructor/me like to teach.

We will generally start by unpacking what Neil has talked about. It helps that we can watch the video and pause it whenever we like. It might take us a day to work through a class video. Three hours is a long time to sit down for anyone.
I develop activities that encourage working together, getting to know each other, becoming comfortable with the archive and building on other people's work. To explore, to acknowledge that students bring knowledge & skills with them. To start getting the right search terms, to get to know the broader fab community, to feel confident about expressing opinions, to learn how to learn etc. 

For me, each week has a primary outcome and a secondary outcome. The primary outcome is engaging with others and the (fab) world, to gain a sense of agency in this new digitally enhanced environment, to begin to find each person's place. The secondary outcome is to learn how to do the tasks.
 
##### A statement that demonstrates your knowledge about how students learn in your discipline.

Our students learn in many ways - but one of the reasons they are attracted to fab academy is that it is learning through making. Some students are very comfortable working in groups, others prefer to work alone. Some students take notes, some never take notes. Some are very comfortable writing in english, some are more comfortable starting in their first language and translating afterwards. 

I encourage students to document the way they are most comfortable and to take on roles in group work that suit their styles the best, but to also push themselves to try new methods and roles. Fab Academy is an opportunity to experiment and try new things, where it's OK to make a mistake and learn from it. 

##### Your plans for developing yourself as a teacher.

I'm always trying out new ways of teaching and adapting old ways. I read a bit of [Papert](http://www.papert.org/), [Piaget](https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html) and [Constructionism/Constructivism](http://guzdial.cc.gatech.edu/Commentary/construct.html), and talk a lot with other people. I test things out with my students - ask them how the session went and what might have worked better, what worked well. They teach me, I teach them. 

I often say:
**'I'm not an expert, I've just had more time to make mistakes and learn from them than you'.**
