# Teaching Ethos

Throughout these sessions, ensure that you are helping them to get to know each other and that they know that you don't know absolutely everything in the whole wide world. We cannot know everything there is to know about everything, but we can teach people how to search for information and then evaluate the usefulness of the information that they find. The environment that we create now is the one that lasts. 

If someone asks you a question and you have already helped someone else with that, you can say "Mr Blahblah can answer that question" and then you support Mr Blahblah to answer it. If someone is having a problem, check to see if anyone else is having that problem, and invite everyone to come and see a way to solve it. Set up your sessions so that they know that searching on a 'preferred search engine' is often your first step and is just a matter of getting the question right. The attitude you want to communicate throughout is: let's solve this together.

##### Your ideas about what constitutes effective teaching, in general, and your specific objectives for the course(s) you teach (or will teach).

I teach using a maker-centred approach - this varies according to the needs I identify in the classroom/fab lab. 
There is a strong emphasis on exploration into materials and processes, within an open source ethos. Everyone is encouraged to work together, using peer-learning or distributed learning to build on pre-existing work and to share their discoveries so that everyone succeeds.
A maker-centred approach is combined with a project-based approach during fab academy - given the nature of the weekly assignments, it is essential to provide comprehensive structure to a learning experience. A project-based approach is applied more in the first half of the course, where new concepts are introduced, but in the second half of academy the teaching style becomes more maker-centred. 
My overall objective for the participants in the course is that they become more and more curious about everything. That their confidence increases as the relationships between the students and the instructors become more comfortable. The curiosity and the confidence combine to create an engaged learner who is excited about the possibilities of fab labs, digital fabrication, open source etc and is empowered to get involved.

##### A description of the ways in which you make decisions about course content and teaching methodologies.

It is our job to synthesise the information that is delivered to the students by Neil every week, and to bring that into our local lab in a meaningful way. The way that I do that depends a little on who the students are and a little on who the instructors are. 
A few of the questions I might ask when deciding how to structure a week/course are: What are their strengths, what do they already know, and how does the instructor/me like to teach.
We generally start by unpacking what Neil has talked about. It helps that we can watch the video and pause it whenever we like. It might take us a day to work through a class video. Three hours is a long time to sit down for anyone.
I develop activities that encourage working together, getting to know each other, becoming comfortable with the archive and building on other people's work. To explore, to acknowledge that students bring knowledge & skills with them. To start getting the right search terms, to get to know the broader fab community, to feel confident about expressing opinions, to learn how to learn etc. 
For me, each week has a primary outcome and a secondary outcome. The primary outcome is engaging with others and the (fab) world, to gain a sense of agency in this new digitally enhanced environment, to begin to find each person's place. The secondary outcome is to learn how to do 2D & 3D modelling.
 
##### A statement that demonstrates your knowledge about how students learn in your discipline.

Our students learn in many ways - but one of the reasons they are attracted to fab academy is that it is learning through making. Some students are very comfortable working in groups, others prefer to work alone. Some students take notes, some never take notes. Some are very comfortable writing in english, some are more comfortable starting in their first language and translating afterwards. I encourage students to document the way they are most comfortable and to take on roles in group work that suit their styles the best, but to also push themselves to try new methods and roles. Fab Academy is an opportunity to experiment and try new things, where it's OK to make a mess and learn from it. 

##### Your plans for developing yourself as a teacher.

I'm always trying out new ways of teaching and adapting old ways. I read a bit of Papert, Piaget, and talk a lot with other people. I test things out with my students - ask them how the session went and what might have worked better, what worked well. They teach me, I teach them. I often say
'I'm not an expert, I've just had more time to make mistakes and learn from them than you'.
