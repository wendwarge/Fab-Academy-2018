# Challenging Behaviours

The most difficult thing for me is when people won't ask for fear of looking stupid or making mistakes. And then they don't do the assignment but if asked, they say it's going well, when really, it isn't. Sometimes that comes from living in a culture that punishes or mocks any small mistake. Sometimes it's because they misinterpret the framework of independent learning - yes, you should try to do things on your own, but at a certain point, the reason we're doing this is to learn how to collaborate with other people. How can you collaborate if you don't communicate with others? 

I used to have a colleague who would take on tasks in a group project, and then not do them. We would have meetings about the project, and he would accept the meeting, but then not attend. And not answer emails or phone calls. The outcome would always be that someone else would do the work and it would be stressful because it wasn't on-time. And everyone would be a bit resentful - if he'd told everyone he couldn't do it, then we would have either offered to help, or taken over the task so that it could be completed in time. These sort of behaviours aren't conducive to a positive working or learning environment.  

## Classic Avoidance Behaviours

Anything that someone does to avoid doing what they are supposed to be doing, but examples are:
- arriving too late or not arriving at all
- talking about anything else
- avoiding people
- telling little lies (claiming other responsibilities, sickness, dramas, traffic jams, broken phone/computer etc)
- pretending lack of understanding or that they didn't 'get the memo'
- 'demonising' the instructor (they're unfair, mean, don't know what they're talking about, why should I listen to them)

Ideally your students are grown up enough to identify these behaviours themselves. If not, a general session about dealing with the stress of impending deadlines might help here. If they turn up, it may help them, if they don't, at least you've tried. Some of these behaviours are very ingrained and it's not up to us to fix absolutely everything.

## Techniques for dealing with Avoidance Behaviours

Feel the fear and do it anyway! What is the overall objective? To learn new and scary things. What is the worst thing that could happen? Seriously, think about the worst thing that could happen if you do that task. It might not succeed? So what, try again. Maybe you'll understand more about the task and be successful the second or third time. Make a small start, with one tiny element of the task. The whole task will begin to feel smaller and easier to accomplish. See [Educational Ethos](educational_ethos.md) for more detail about Spiral Development and [Reflective Practice](reflective_practice.md).

Also, you might find that there are significant cultural differences that can be misread as challenging behaviours. Please check the [Cultural Diversity page](cultural_diversity.md) for more about this.


## Panic Decisions

When we get stressed, we sometimes make poor decisions, especially in a situation where we don't have much experience. For instance, if you've been avoiding doing an assignment and then you suddenly realise that the deadline is near, you might decide to just do the assignment you've been avoiding. Often this results in a poor outcome because you haven't planned properly and it's the first time you've done something. 

If this is one of your students and you can see that they're heading in the wrong direction and making lots of unnecessary work for themselves, you'll want to help them by stopping them. Their response might be resentment. They think you're stopping them from completing their task, whereas you think you're stopping them from making a huge mistake. In this situation, sometimes it's best to step down and allow them to make the mistakes, and then help them fix it afterwards. If it's a big mistake though, it might be better to persist. Having a team approach to this situation helps - if all the staff know what the strategy is for their project, then everyone supports the decision to stop the student and is able to explain that we're doing it for them. Having the other students on board with this as well, so that they will step in to stop each other from making big mistakes helps a lot. Incorporate this into a [Code of Conduct](space.md) and re-iterate it weekly.
