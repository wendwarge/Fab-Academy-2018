# Computer-Controlled Cutting

## Laser Cutting

**Include Pre-Academy documentation:** Use a pre-existing [grasshopper definition](http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/grasshopper-code) such as Seamless Pattern and adjust it, then print it out. Copy someone else's pressfit kit from a previous year. 

**Group Assignment:** Instead of doing the basic 'comb' test, I usually recommend this ['snapfit'](https://tltl.stanford.edu/project/universal-snap-fit) joint. Or starting with the comb and then moving on to this one.

We can make the group project that they design a giant pressfit kit together, and then make individual parametric patterns to cut within each object. These can then be put together as screens to divide up spaces in the lab, or used by new groups in the Lab as part of introductory activities. 

## Vinyl Cutting

**Include Pre Academy documentation:** Make a vinyl sticker in Inkscape. Print it using Fab Modules. 
If pre-academy happened, then we can do something interesting here, like make screenprinted fab academy scarves with a 0011010101 pattern (to wear at Fab14) using [photochromic pigments](https://solarcolordust.com/t/solar-color-dust) or flexible circuit nametags.
