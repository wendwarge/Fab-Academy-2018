# Computer-Controlled Cutting

## Laser Cutting

**Include Pre-Academy documentation:** Use a pre-existing [grasshopper definition](http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/grasshopper-code) such as Seamless Pattern and adjust it, then print it out. Copy someone else's pressfit kit from a previous year. 
**Group Assignment:** Instead of doing the basic 'comb' test, I usually recommend this ['snapfit'](https://tltl.stanford.edu/project/universal-snap-fit) joint. Or starting with the comb and then moving on to this one.

## Vinyl Cutting

**Include Pre Academy documentation:** Make a vinyl sticker in Inkscape. Print it using Fab Modules. 
If pre-academy happened, then we can do something interesting here, like make screenprinted fab academy scarves or flexible circuit nametags.
