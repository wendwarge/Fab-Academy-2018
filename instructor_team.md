## Instructor team

As mentioned at the beginning, it is preferable to have a small team of instructors than an individual who is responsible for absolutely everything.

Consider your potential team, and the individual strengths of each member in the context of Fab Academy.

I suggest you have each experienced team member lead one week that they are very comfortable with, and have another less experienced team member supporting so they learn more about that week. The lead can plan and run the initial sessions and the other team member will learn how to deliver the programme while supporting the students to carry out the relevant tasks. Each team member would learn more in either role, and this would build the resilience of your team and the programme.

There is also the opportunity to offer the sessions to the broader community so that students meet other people, and the other people get to understand what is involved in Fab Academy. This makes Fab Academy part of the everyday activities of the Lab rather than something that consumes enormous resources.
