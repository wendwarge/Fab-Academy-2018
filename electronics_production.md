# Electronics Production

The challenge this week is for our students to document this project as interestingly as possible!
- remember who your audience is - the global evaluator and other fab academy students. Show your personality and make people understand the pain, the frustration and the funny parts of fab academy.

**Research task:** Look at a lot of student pages and find the funny moments, the humourous stories, and the most entertaining documentation. What is it that makes that page stand out from other pages? Decide what you might try with your documentation this week.
