# Electronics Production

The challenge this week is for our students to document this project as interestingly as possible!

- remember who your audience is: the global evaluator and other fab academy students. 

Show your personality and help people **_feel_** the satisfaction, the pain, the frustration and the hilarious parts of your fab academy journey.

**Research task:** Look at a lot of student pages for this week and find the funny moments, the humorous stories, and the most entertaining documentation. What is it that makes one page stand out from other pages? Based on this, decide what you might try with your documentation this week.
