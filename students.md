## Spreading the word to potential students

Begin to talk about Fab Academy to the local community via your usual channels more intensively in November, but do some teasers earlier than that too - instagram, facebook, slack, posters/flyers etc. Use the marketing material provided by Fab Academy coordination which is located in an Academany [repository](https://github.com/Academany) on Github (at the moment). 

Post photos of graduates and their work & announce that your lab is hosting Fab Academy again in 20XX. Focus more on group photos than individual. You're going to attract people who like working with others, other people will prefer to learn online at home alone. If it's a photo of someone's final project (because you haven't got 'people' shots), you can say "Do you want to learn how to make something like this?" "Find out more about how this _blahblah_ was developed at our upcoming information evening". "Meet the creator of this _blahblah_ and find out how they made it". Focus on the global connections, worldwide movement etc (you can learn how to use a laser cutter anywhere, but you can't connect with the global fab community anywhere else). Hashtags #fablabs #fabacademy20XX #fablabuae etc

Host information evenings and advertise them as above. See below for an outline. 

- if there's enough interest, you could host a 2nd 'higher level' one, where the potential students could make something together, stickers, pressfit something, 3D print.

## Selecting students

I can be available for short conversations with potential students in my evening/your morning. 

Fab Academy is a combination of training and education. It is not essential to have any prior experience as the most important things are enthusiasm, curiosity, being open to experimenting, and a willingness to work hard, share, work alone and in groups. It is nice to have a variety of students, with different backgrounds and interests, bringing their unique perspectives with them to the group.

Example questions I might ask, depending on what they've written in their application:
- Tell me more about your experience so far with digital fabrication &/or fab labs.
- Tell me about a time when you worked on a group project. What was your role in the group, how did you plan it, was it successful, what would you do differently next time.
- What unique skills or experience do you bring with you? 
- Tell me what you think the future of digital fabrication is.
- Are you aware that this course is very intensive? Do you have any other responsibilities during fab academy?
- Have you any thoughts about what your final project might be?
- What is the most exciting thing about this course for you?
- Have you ever made anything?
- What are you most proud of achieving in your life?
- Have you heard of Open Source Design?

## Information evening for shortlisted applicants

- Tell people what the plan for the evening is. "First we're going to..." and don't forget to tell them that they'll be able to look around at the end. (Wendy)
- Have a round of introductions so that everyone begins to know each other and what their background is. (Wendy)
- Talk about who will be the instructors this cycle and the overall programme. (Wendy & Ahmed)
- Speak of your own experience with Fab Academy and show a bit of your progress on your page. Invite another graduate to talk as well. Laugh and agree with each other a lot. Laugh about how hard you worked, how much you learnt and how much fun you had. (Ahmed & ...)
- Have a slide show on a big screen as people enter the room - photos of you all working hard, making things, your final project slides, photos at Fab 13. (Ahmed and/or Marwa to arrange)
- Show people around the lab at the end so then you can point out the equipment that was used for each project. Display the final projects and the MTM project (if they all still exist) nearby so you can point them out. If you haven't got those, point out other projects that use similar skills. 
- Have the application forms ready for people to fill out straightaway. Or a paper version for your local application.
