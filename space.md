# Setting up an excellent learning space

See also the Teaching Ethos section.

The students will be in your fab lab for about six months; making things, learning about and doing spiral development and relying on us and each other to get them through the programme. 

The best way that I have found for them to do that is to have a special space allocated for them, where they can store their things, be close to each other and **amidst the other activities of the fab lab**.

Ideally, it would be a section of a large room that other people also use, not in a separate room. They would have some desk space, a couch nearby  &  useful books, and some of the essential equipment in the room, like the MDX20, soldering station, electronics inventory, a couple of 3D printers, a couple of good dual-boot desktop computers loaded up with software, a storage shelf each etc. It will have a whiteboard or large brown paper on the wall for brainstorming ideas/planning a workflow/leaving messages etc. This will help them to have a workflow, and not get stuck 'just thinking' about the next task. It would also have the big screen connected to the MCU. And it won't be messy (see Code of Conduct).

We're setting up a design studio here. Where people work together on their own projects and group projects, inspiring and supporting each other, especially when they get stuck or have a 'eureka moment'. This is not a classroom or an office, but we will have class sessions in there and meetings and maybe even cups of tea. 

The benefits of this are also that the students are visible to your broader fab lab community, who may start to consider doing Academy in the next cycle, as well as being a focal point in a tour of the fab lab for casual visitors. It's all part of the Open Source ethos, as well as helping them feel like part of something bigger. Not just six or seven people in a room - a group of people representing Fab Lab UAE to the world, and representing Fab Academy to the local community. 

## Code of Conduct

We will establish a Code of Conduct within the first week, which will set out expected group behaviours towards each other and how we all work in the space. Maybe we can make our first video together - watch the [Tom Sachs video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49p1JVLHUos) as a fun but serious example. There are a number of existing Codes of Conduct that have an Open License, but I advise caution when looking to Fab Lab Wgtn here - I believe that we were the first fab lab to create a Code of Conduct, but our Code is based on specific cultural values that do not match the values of Fab lab UAE, and may cause offense.
