# Setting up an excellent learning space

See also the Teaching Philosophy section.

The students will be in your fab lab for about six months; making things, learning about and doing spiral development and relying on us and each other to get them through the programme. 

The best way that I have found for them to do that is to have a special space allocated for them, where they can store their things, be close to each other and **amidst the other activities of the fab lab**.

Ideally, it would be a section of a large room, not in a separate room. They would have some desk space, a couch nearby  &  useful books, and some of the essential equipment in the room, like the MDX20, soldering station, a couple of 3D printers, a couple of good dual-boot desktop computers loaded up with software, a storage shelf each etc. It also helps to have a whiteboard or large brown paper on the wall for brainstorming ideas/planning a workflow/leaving messages etc. This will help them to have a workflow, and not get stuck 'just thinking' about the next task. It would also have the big screen connected to the MCU.

You're setting up a design studio. Where people work together on their own projects and group projects, inspiring and supporting each other, especially when they get stuck or have a 'eureka moment'.

The benefits of this are also that the students are visible to your broader fab lab community, who may start to consider doing Academy in the next cycle, as well as being a point in a tour of the fab lab for casual visitors. It's all part of the Open Source ethos, as well as helping them feel like part of something bigger. Not just six or seven people in a room - a group of people representing Fab Lab UAE to the world, and representing Fab Academy to the local community.
