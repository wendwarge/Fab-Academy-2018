## Educational Ethos

Fab Academy is a big challenge for two main reasons. 

1.  Learning new technical skills, both software and hardware.
2.  Learning that *process* is as important as, if not more important than, outcome.

In the context of digital fabrication, you can learn how to use a laser cutter or 3D printer anywhere now, but you can't learn how to learn from your own process just anywhere. Once you do learn how you learn, you can apply it anywhere and to anything.

### Process Context

Most of us are taught within an educational system that is either standards-based or achievement-based. The outcomes are very clear: to achieve the former, you must do a fixed range of things to be successful, whereas in the latter, you are encouraged (through the grading system) to achieve between ~50% and 100%. A perfect mark within the achievement-based system does not mean that the student knows absolutely everything, but that they have acheived all of the things, and possibly more, that the grading schedule recognises as extended skills or knowledge at that level.

These two systems exist because we have 'hard' and 'soft' expertise. For instance, imagine if you needed a Brain Surgeon - would you want a doctor who got 50% right in their exams? No, you want a very high scoring graduate. Whereas, in design disciplines, it is possible to have a variety of styles and methods that aren't necessary but are considered nice to have. In either case, it is recognised that practise improves the initial results and that the original results may be no reflection on the eventuating professional practice.

Although Fab Academy is evaluated to a fairly loosely framed standard, students are encouraged to achieve as much as possible in the course for their own satisfaction. At the same time, perfect success is not the only measure - students are encouraged to document their 'failures' and refect on what they'd do differently next time. For many people, this is an unfathomable aspect of Fab Academy and when people ask: what is the standard? this is what they are asking about.  

It is a big leap for graduates of a traditional standards-based system to engage with the seemingly amorphous system of Fab Academy. Spiral Development is the framework within which we work and this is the essence of 'learning how to learn' in a maker-centred learning environment.

For a designer, this process is integrated into their practise, because design is always experiemental. For an engineer, this process is outside their experience because engineering follows specific rules. Becuase we're operating within a new field, all the rules haven't been made yet, so there is a lot of room for experimentation. We're still constrained by things like the rules of physics, but we can 'play' a lot more.

### Spiral Development

Spiral Development assumes that you don't know everything. It also assumes that even though you might not be generating new knowledge for humanity, you are generating new knowledge for yourself through experiential learning.  If you are aiming to achieve an outcome but you don't know how, or if it's even possible to achieve this, you can ask yourself: what is the first, small project that I can do to test my idea or understanding? I often refer to it as the Bare Minimum. If you were working in the standards-based system, the Bare Minimum would be sufficient. But in Fab Academy you reflect on your findings, evaluate them and go a little further. These are the sort of reflective questions you might ask.
-   Was my first Bare Minimum realistic or do I need to scale it back?
-   Which parts were successful and why?
-   While I was doing this, did I make a surprise discovery that has changed my initial idea?
-   What do I need to do differently or change about my idea to progress it?

With your new understanding, you would ask:

What is the next thing I can do to test that my idea has merit, or that my new understanding is robust?
