# Computer-Aided Design

For instance, in CAD week - I'll ask the students to spend an hour in pairs searching out software reviews about the software that Neil lists. I'll ask them to check particular students' websites I've selected from previous academy years to see what they have said. When we come together to speak about their findings, we'll discuss the pros & cons of open source and free software versus proprietary software. The next task might be to swap the pairs around and to test a couple of different software each making the same object. What were the differences/similarities? If one of the students has a lot of experience in Rhino, I might invite them to give an overview of the basics of it to the group, if people are interested and the student is feeling confident. Depending on who is instructing, we might run a session on Grasshopper, Sketch up, solidworks etc.
