# Computer-Aided Design

Which software are we going to encourage the use of?

The three CAD weeks from 2016 or 2017:
- 
- 
- 

**Research:** We'll ask the students to spend an hour in pairs searching out software reviews about the software that Neil lists. We'll ask them to look at the above students' websites to see what they have said. 

**Discussion:** When we come together to speak about their findings, we'll discuss the pros & cons of open source and free software versus proprietary software. 

**Testing & Evaluating:** We'll swap the pairs around and they will test a couple of different softwares each, making the same object. What were the differences/similarities? Were the online tutorials useful? What about youtube videos etc. We'll make a comparison table.

**Tutorials:** If one of the students has experience in Rhino/Solidworks/Meshmixer etc., I might invite them to give an overview of the basics of it to the group, if people are interested and the student is feeling confident. Depending on who is instructing, we might run a session on Grasshopper, Sketch up, solidworks etc.
