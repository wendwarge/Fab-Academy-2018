# Cultural Diversity
 
There are many things to consider when inviting someone, whether it's mentors or students for Fab Academy or for another project, from the global community to join you in your Fab Lab. Or for that matter, when you're collaborating at a distance or visiting other fab labs.

The global Fab network has led to a connection of international people in a extraordinary way. In the past, we would collaborate with people from our own or nearby countries, whereas now we are talking on a daily basis to many people from different countries, using a variety of platforms as well as in person. Accordingly, we need new skills to do this.

But most of us don't know much about how local culture impacts on our global interaction. Even those who have travelled extensively, and have lived overseas often have few strategies for dealing with the cross-cultural complexity that affects day-to-day interactions between diverse cultures.

The richness of our cultural diversity is not something that we should lose or try to 'fix' by making it bland and uniform - each of us brings our own unique perspective, and fab labs need to be spaces where these differences are understood and are celebrated as being beneficial to our overall development.

It's easy to say 'Oh, they're never on time - how do they ever get anything done?' *OR* 'They're so rigid - why can't they relax and just get on with it?' If we don't spend some time working together to understand these differences, then statements like: 'I'll never work with anyone from that country again.' or 'That person is impossible to work with!' become normal and shut down further opportunities for understanding.

A great book for helping us understand this is the [Culture Map](https://www.erinmeyer.com/book/) by Erin Meyer. 

An example of her thinking around this is the differences in attitudes to scheduling.

You can see that countries are spread all across the spectrum - obviously the ones at either end are going to have to work hard to understand each other, but, as Erin Meyer points out, countries closer together are relatively different. In the above example, Polish people might find French people too relaxed but Russians might find the French too rigid.

The following example showing differences in hierarchies is also quite illuminating. It becomes interesting when you think that often the countries who are most inflexible about time are the least hierarchical in their leadership qualities.

I highly recommend reading this book and discussing it frequently with others.
