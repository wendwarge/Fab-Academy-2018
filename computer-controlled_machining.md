# Computer-Controlled Machining


Start mixing up the week's projects - there still isn't any material or cutters for the ShopBot so:

1. do a session on prototyping a piece of furniture - Wendy: Ranjan Alna
2. start sketching and researching a design idea for 'make something big'.
3. finish off making the hello.ftdi + LED board.
4. scale cardboard models, preferably in 6.5mm. Link to this exploration from CCC week in documentation.
5. do the test pattern on the SRM 20s.
6. do a multimeter session - Hashim. document on E Design Week.
7. coding session?



Give the students test joints to make from the [Digital Wood joints file](http://www.flexiblestream.org/project/50-digital-wood-joints). Get the poster from [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/50-Digital-Joints-poster-visual-reference/)
