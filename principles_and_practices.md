# Principles and Practices

If we haven't done Pre Academy, then we'll do some of the tasks in that.

The three websites from 2016 or 2017:
- [Helga](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/hauksdottir.sigridur_helga/index.html) 
- [JC Chang](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtaipei/students/184/#portfolio)
- [Hyejin](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabseoul/students/351/)

**Research:** Look at previous students' work and evaluate. Make notes of the tools they have used and explore the resources associated with them. 

- do a git [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [two](http://learngitbranching.js.org/). or [three](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science)

- do some W3 [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/). 

Use the google search bar in the archive. 

- look at the [hello world thing](https://helloworldcollection.github.io/) that Neil talks about.
