# Project Management

You're showing the students around the system they'll be working in, helping them to be comfortable with where everything is and how to use it: continue with tutorials - begin to look through the tutorials in the archive.

set selves up in gitlab 

show the students when we put up the lab page.

## Why do we have open documentation? 

So that we can all build on other people's work, in an honourable way, and that we can collaborate in a digital environment without being inconsiderate and untidy. The points below particularly focus on the techniques that show respect and indicate that you are a good potential collaborator. 

## Acknowledge other people's work
If you are inspired by or use other people's work, you need to treat them as you would like to be treated. Acknowledgement is respectful and essential. Often the work that you find is licensed, for instance, the [torture test](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:33902) that many people use in 3D printing week. It is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license. Attribution means that you should *acknowledge* who designed it whenever you talk about using it or post photos of prints of the object.

Examples other people's work can include:
- quotes from websites 
- images not taken by you 
- music for your videos
- use of templates
- free vector or 3D files
- assistance, training, advice or education you received from others
- code

*Always check the licenses* You do not want to end up with a final project that can't be continued or has to be unpublished because you've ignored the conditions of a license for the code you used.

## Compress and resize your images and videos Design files in original format and generically readable format
Don't fill up your repo with unnecessary 'weight'. Don't rely on code to resize your images. Platforms with free storage have a limited size, and when you're paying for your own storage you want to be conservative.

## Design files in original format and generically readable format
Make it possible for anyone to see what you're working on and, if they have the software you're using, to modify and make adaptations. Don't limit opportunities by locking your work into proprietary software.

## Naming Conventions
Whether you are collaborating or working alone, naming things meaningfully is essential. We've all made a file that's called something like final_final_last_one.dxf, 03.jpg, pocket1.sbp, week1.zip etc but we all know that we can never remember afterwards what it was for. Weeks later we open it up, realise what it is, and promise ourselves to rename it and then forget until the next time we find it. 

Call your files something useful. Establish a naming convention and continue it. Use your initials, the name of the project, the content, the date - any combination will do, as long as it's informative and continues. This includes naming your browser tabs, naming and organising your folders in your website, your zipped files, your images.
