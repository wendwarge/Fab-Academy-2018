# Pre-Academy Activities

It is a good idea to offer some sessions prior to Academy. These sessions serve a few purposes: to introduce the students to some basic skills and the fab lab spaces, to introduce them to the ethos of the programme and thirdly, **most importantly**, introduce them to each other & the instructor/s. Building a strong team feeling early in the programme will help everyone to succeed together instead of competitively.

I can phone in as the 'regional reviewer' at the beginning to introduce the day's work with a short lecture and Carl can be a remote student. It'll be a taste of the global programme in every way.

Activities that I suggest are:

- learning about Open Source licenses. Look at the Creative Commons [website](https://creativecommons.org/) and examine a few examples of people using open licenses - [Ultimaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimaker), [thingiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingiverse), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia). Do the group project for the 3D printing week: download a torture test from thingiverse. Check and discuss the license - what would you write on your fab academy page to acknowledge this license? Discuss what sort of license you might choose for your final project. If you modified the torture test and uploaded the new version to thingiverse, how would you acknowledge the originator? *Fab Lab UAE to 'tip the designer' on behalf of the students and to ensure the students know that it has been done.*

- learn about using BASH. Follow the Bash for Beginners [tutorial](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting) or another tutorial that you like more.

- practice some basics using open source software. Learn how to resize & compress photos using Gimp. Use [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) to change image size via command line. Make a vinyl sticker in Inkscape. Download an SVG from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) Pay attention to the licence. Print it using Fab Modules. Make a tinkercad model and print it out, using the knowledge gained from the torture test. Try out [Antimony](http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/3/) & [NodeBox3](https://www.nodebox.net/node/).  

- do a git [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [two](http://learngitbranching.js.org/).

- do some W3 [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/).

I would combine these into 2 sessions, where they do some computing and some making in each. Maybe W3 & OS licenses, then Bash, git & OS software.

If there's time, they could also:

- make a fabISP (inventory?)

- learn some fusion 360 and copy someone else's pressfit kit from a previous year. Evaluate that person's documentation and decide whether you would do it differently & how. Is it the layout of the website, the style of writing, too many images/not enough images etc. Use a pre-existing [grasshopper definition](http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/grasshopper-code) such as Seamless Pattern and adjust it, then print it out.   

Throughout these activities, they will develop the habit of taking screenshots and photos & videos of each other doing interesting fabby things and uploading them to a shared folder because they can use all of this in their Fab Academy documentation. Of course. And also, it's a good habit to start early... #fablabuae #fabacademy2018 etc.

### For next week, have you:

- Ensured that [Time Snapper Classic](http://www.timesnapper.com/DownloadClassic.aspx) is installed on the windows side of any computers that will be used during Fab Academy. Or one of these [alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/timesnapper/) for other platforms.
- Checked that all the software is up to date on the lab computers
- Checked the MCU connection & tested the microphone/speakers
- Booked the equipment & rooms we'll need for next week
- Found three examples of good but differing fab academy websites & styles of documentation from last year's students so that we can analyse them in class.
- Created the Lab page on the Archive
- Posted a group photo on social media of the new fablabuae fab academy students
- Ensured that there is 3 or 4mm corrugated cardboard ordered for Week Three and that there is enough electronics inventory for the fabISP project
- Sent a message to all of the students reminding them of the time & place of the first class and thanking them for getting involved in Pre-Academy
