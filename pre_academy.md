# Pre-Academy Activities

I suggest that you offer some sessions during your winter holiday. These sessions will serve three purposes: to introduce the students to some basic skills, to introduce them to the ethos of the programme and thirdly, **most importantly**, introduce them to each other. Building a strong team feeling early in the programme will help everyone to succeed together instead of competitively. I can phone in as the 'regional reviewer' and Carl can be a remote student. It'll be a taste of the global programme in every way.

Activities that I suggest are:

- learning about Open Source licenses. Look at the Creative Commons [website](https://creativecommons.org/) and examine a few examples of people using open licenses - Ultimaker, thingiverse, wikipedia. Do the group project for the 3D printing week: download a torture test from thingiverse. Check and discuss the license - what would you write on your fab academy page to acknowledge this license?

- learn about using BASH. Follow the Bash for Beginners [tutorial](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting) or another tutorial that you like more.

- learn some basics of open source software. Learn how to resize & compress photos using Gimp. Make a vinyl sticker in Inkscape. Make a tinkercad model and print it out, using the knowledge gained from the torture test.  

- do a git [tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [two](http://learngitbranching.js.org/).

- do some W3 [tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/). 

I would combine these into 2 sessions, where they do some computing and some making in each. Maybe W3 & OS licenses, then Bash, git & OS software.

Throughout these activities, they must take screenshots and photos & videos of each other doing interesting fabby things and upload them to a shared folder because they can use all of this in their fab Academy documentation. Of course. And also, it's a good habit to start early... #fablabuae #fabacademy2018 etc.
