Ask the students to get into 2 groups and research one of two options - hot wire cutter & XY plotter.
 - we will give them some links to start their research, once they've created their teams.
 - they need to find out what materials and components we have in the lab.
 - easy processes and managable workloads are key.
 - they can focus on what each of them is good at, but need to get the whole process.
 
They have two days to prepare a pitch, where they have to convince us that their idea is the best. 

After the two pitches, we will decide which one they will plan and make as a whole group.

This will happen prior to Wednesday's class.
