# Cultural Mapping
 

The global Fab network has led to a connection of international people in a unique way. Where we might have been expected to primarily collaborate with colleagues from our own country, today many of us are scattered around the world. Yet most of us have little understanding of how local culture impacts global interaction. Even those who are culturally informed, travel extensively, and have lived abroad often have few strategies for dealing with the cross-cultural complexity that affects day-to-day effectiveness.

There are many things to consider when inviting someone, whether it's mentors or students for Fab Academy or for another project, from the global community to join you in your Fab Lab. Or for that matter, when you're collaborating at a distance or visiting other fab labs.
